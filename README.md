# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.  
It uses **Machine Learning algorithms** like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM to classify patients.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: [Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)  
- Features: 13 medical attributes (age, sex, chol, trestbps, etc.)  
- Target: `0` → No Heart Disease, `1` → Heart Disease  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy (Data handling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (ML Models)  
- Jupyter Notebook (Development)  

## 🚀 Steps in Project  
1. Data Loading & Exploration  
2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
3. Splitting into Train/Test sets  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)  
5. Model Evaluation & Accuracy Comparison  
6. Saving & Loading Model (joblib)  

## 📊 Results  
- **Logistic Regression**: 88.5%  
- **Decision Tree**: 75.4%  
- **Random Forest**: 83.6%  
- **SVM**: 70.4%  

✅ Logistic Regression performed the best on this dataset.
